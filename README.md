RVL-CDIP could be looked at as the equivalent of ImageNet for the document image community. 
It’s certainly the largest we’ve seen in the literature. There are 400,000 total document images in the dataset.
The dataset contains much noise and variance in composition of each document class. Uncompressed, the dataset size is ~100GB,
and comprises 16 classes of document types, with 25,000 samples per classes. Example classes include email, resume, 
and invoice. Achieved an Accuracy of over 93% which beat the benchmark score of 92% based
